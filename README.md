# RasPi Projects

Collection of various scripts, projects, and other material in developing circuits and functionality
on a Raspberry PI microcomputer. This repository is a way to keep all materials in one location
and build over time, with the intention of re-learning basics and eventually growing into a larger
collection of advanced materials.

## Circuit Diagrams

Most project folders have a README that includes a circuit diagram plus a `circuit` folder within them
which contains the original [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) project file for the circuit diagram.
