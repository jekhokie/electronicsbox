# RasPi Projects

Collection of various scripts, projects, and other material in developing circuits and functionality
on a Raspberry PI microcomputer. This repository is a way to keep all materials in one location
and build over time, with the intention of re-learning basics and eventually growing into a larger
collection of advanced materials.
